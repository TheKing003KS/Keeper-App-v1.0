# Keeper App

This is my first React webapp.

It is a note making app. The user can create multiple notes and delete them.

Keeper App v1.0 only implements the React front-end part.

To use this app, download this repository, install all the dependencies using npm and Enjoy!!

Update: The 2nd version of Keeper-App can be found at: https://github.com/TheKing003KS/Keeper-App-v2.0

The 2nd version implements a complete MERN stack project.
